# Repeat-item-list-checker
Checks a copied list for duplicates and reports them.

Originally made for a list of title names so you will get false positives if you have 1-2 character searches mixed with titles or long words with the characters in them. 

Everything should work and can be edited to your need. 
If you do not want to copy the list you can input the next needed under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\input_data.txt
Doing so you will need to make sure that your clipboard is clear or you can edit the code. The file will be deleted after the program finishes.
